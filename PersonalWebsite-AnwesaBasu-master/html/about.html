            I am currently pursuing my masters degree in Computer Science from the Khoury College of Computer Sciences, Northeastern University, Boston. I completed my bachelors degree from Institute of Engineering and Management Kolkata (Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology, previously West Bengal University of Technology), in Information Technology. Having completed my undergrad, I joined Infosys Ltd as a software developer, and worked for four year, working in technologies such as ASP.NET, HTML, CSS etc. I intend to work as a full stack developer in the future.

            I also enjoy travelling to scenic locations and going on hikes. Aside from these, I have been involved with a couple of NGOs working with the underprivileged. Seeing the smiles materialize on the faces of the kids would fill me with unparalleled joy, and I hope to be able to contribute to their cause again.
