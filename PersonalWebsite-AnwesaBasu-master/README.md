# PersonalWebsite-AnwesaBasu


# Motivation
This project is to build a personal web page with the help of html,css and javascript.The webpage consists of some pages which showcases different aspects of my career profile.

# My Website(Hosted in Heroku)
https://personalwebpage2311.herokuapp.com/



# Requirements

# 1
A landing page. This is the top page, defined in index.html, which your viewers will land on. It should let people know what the site is about and contain the necessary links and navigation for people to get around the site.

## Landing page(Home)
The landing page is home where the user will land on and it will have a side navbar which can be used to navigate to other pages.
<img width="946" alt="HomePage" src="https://media.github.ccs.neu.edu/user/11302/files/dc42f7f3-7415-4d62-8bf8-e2181efec072">
As it can be seen that at the top right there is a navbar which directs the user to go to different pages and navigate back to the home page etc.
The landing page is index.html which is a home page and if user clicks the home in the navigation bar it returns to this page.
the path for index.html in github is:-


# 2
One or more navigational elements, such as a header bar, footer bar, or side menu. How you design the navigational element(s) is up to you, but your site should be easy to navigate. There should be no dead ends, and the user should not need to resort to the browser's navigation buttons to get where they want to go. Navigational elements should not scroll out of sight or disappear when the window is resized. Color and positioning of the navigational elements should be styled in CSS.

## Navigational Element

As discussed earlier in every page navbar has been added and it does not scroll out of sight or disspear when the window is resized. 
<img width="343" alt="navbar" src="https://media.github.ccs.neu.edu/user/11302/files/41d4dce7-8802-43fb-a346-699b2bc2bc37">
In the above screenshot it can be seen that the window has been resized and the page has been scrolled down to the last and still the navigation bar
can be observed.

# 3

Two or more internal links. These should link to separate pages or specific HTML elements within your site. For example, a personal page might have an internal link to a "CV" page and another link to a "Hobbies and Interests" page. A company website might have a link to a "Who We Are" page and a "Products and Services" page. The styling of the internal links should match the styling of the rest of the site, and the navigational elements should be present. Internal links should open their content in the same browser tab as the site is being viewed in. The assignment links on our course web page are examples of this.


## Internal Links

In my webpage aboutme,contact,skills,education all of these navbar menu are internal links to new pages within my website. In the below screenshot if the url
is noticed then it can be seen that an internal link has been used to navigate to another page.

<img width="944" alt="internallink2" src="https://media.github.ccs.neu.edu/user/11302/files/3b10df78-d8bb-4310-b951-b4110cb97783">


In both the above screenshots it can be clearly seen that internal links have been used.

# 4
One or more external links. The external link(s) should open new browser tabs so that your site remains open in the user's browser. The Blackboard and Piazza links on our course website are examples of this.

## External Link

In the contact me page I have added external links for other social media platforms such as facebook,instagram also linkedin and github.
I have also added a link which will redirect the user to outlook for sending an email to my mail id.

<img width="655" alt="External Links" src="https://media.github.ccs.neu.edu/user/11302/files/28abb6bc-e6f7-4998-9575-a12f1a3ba0c4">

In the above screenshot the yellow higligted parts are the external links which will redirect to another websites in another browser.


# 5

At least one HTML table, with CSS styling. Tables enable you to organize elements into columns and rows. Tables are a great way to display work or education history on a CV, or to constrain components (such as images and corresponding text) to display in rows. The schedule on the landing page of our course website is an example of table layout. With CSS, you can control spacing, borders (or lack of) and other visual aspects.

## Table

A table has been added to showcase the educational details in the education page. Below is the screenshot for the same.

<img width="949" alt="education" src="https://media.github.ccs.neu.edu/user/11302/files/b123e3fe-644f-4607-8015-14cc161d1c2d">


# 6

At least one interactive or animated component. Use jQuery or vanilla JS to give your website a little flair by having an animated menu, resizable item, or interactive highlighting. The way the rows of the schedule on our class syllabus page turn gray when the mouse is over them is a subtle example of how something like this can be used.

## Interactive Component

1)After clicking the download CV button the cutton color changes from black to white.

2)Also in the education table on mouse hover the background of the column color changes.

# 7
Attention to responsiveness. Your site should behave in a reasonable way when viewed on a desktop in a browser, and on a mobile device. Use CSS media queries (Links to an external site.) to make sure that your site looks okay on different sized displays. You can simulate a device display using your browser's development tools. It is also possible to view your website running on localhost in another device on the same network by using the server's IP address as the URL. (The IP address to use is the one that http-server tells you it is serving to, which is not 127.0.0.1).

## Responsive

proper media queries have been used to make the website responsive.
Below is one screenshot for the same.
